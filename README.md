# Backup pterodactyl .sh

## This is a test project.
## ⚠️ Warn : IT HAVE MANY BUGS

1. Chooseable /var/www/pterodactyl and /var/lib/pterodactyl

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backupstart.sh)
```

# This is the same as chooseable one but less one UI
# So use the first (1.) is enough

2. If you want to backup /var/www/pterodactyl use this (I just tested partly)

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backupwwwstart.sh)
```
3. If you want to backup /var/lib/pterodactyl use this (I didn't test this before)(Warn: Pls close panel unless you can't use the function)

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backuplibstart.sh)
```
