## This is a test project.
##⚠️ Warn : IT HAVE MANY BUGS

Chooseable /var/www/pterodactyl and /var/lib/pterodactyl

```

If you want to backup /var/www/pterodactyl use this (I just tested partly)

```
If you want to backup /var/lib/pterodactyl use this (I didn't test this before)(Warn: Pls close panel unless you can't use the function)

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backuplibstart.sh)
```
