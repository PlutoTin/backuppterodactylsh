# backuppterodactylsh

This is a test project, it may have so many bugs.

If you want to backup /var/www/pterodactyl use this (I just tested partly)

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backupwwwstart.sh)
```
If you want to backup /var/lib/pterodactyl use this (I didn't test this before)

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlutoTin/backuppterodactylsh/main/backuplibstart.sh)
```
